“Fast Food Availability & Its Impact on Obesity”

Abstract: This paper questions whether obesity is impacted by fast food per capita. 
Data is taken from all fifty states and analyzed in comparison with several regressors derived from multiple government and business databases. 
With this research, I found significant variables that help explain the incidence of obesity, and I have also found that differences in obesity rates have higher 
incidence among certain ethnic and racial groups.

Tools/Techniques Used to Conduct & Analyze Research:
	Multivariate Regression Modeling
	Use of R software to create comprehensive regression models of data
