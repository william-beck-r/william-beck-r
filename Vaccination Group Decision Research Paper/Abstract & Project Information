“The Dangers of Unmonitored Group Decision: Vaccination Games”

Abstract:
Using both models from the Economics of Game Theory and real-world case studies, this paper created a model to predict the behavior of large groups of people 
to vaccination decisions and outcomes through the lens of a “Large Group Chicken'' collective-action game. 
The results of the model predicted that any given population will most likely not reach a “socially optimal” outcome (i.e., herd immunity) without interference due to 
the following:

1)	Non-participants still receiving benefit as a result of those who do choose to get vaccinated
2)	A population’s suboptimal perception of risks involved (meaning players of this “game” incorrectly underestimate the benefit of getting vaccinated, on average).

Note:  this research project occurred prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and largely predicted population behaviors that occurred during the pandemic.

Tools/Techniques Used to Conduct & Analyze Research:
	Created behavior-prediction equations and model based on Game Theory assumptions
	Analyzed academic journals & research for case studies
