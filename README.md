- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m William Beck Russell
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in continuing my education in statistical languages and analytical platform software 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced SQL and continuing practice with Tableau dashboards
- The purpose of this Github branch is to demonstrate various examples of my work in Excel, SQL, and Tableau, as well as compile research papers from my time in the Texas A&M Economics program in order to show my proficiency at gathering, analyzing, and reporting data findings.
