Abstract: This paper sought to analyze the moral hazard implications of bankruptcy situations for both firms and individual borrowers.  
Previous research had suggested possible moral hazard effects existed due to the “soft budget constraint problem” 
(i.e., banks’ willingness to renegotiate debt terms upon default/bankruptcy situations) of firms. 
Our paper found that firms receive the most benefit of the “soft approach” typically given to them by lenders — although this effect was still fairly minimal — 
while individual debtors do not receive the same benefits, as they lack the bargaining power of a firm.
